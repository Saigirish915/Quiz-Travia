1. Dictionaries
Used to store questions and their corresponding answers.

python
Copy
Edit
questions = {
    "What is...": "def",
    ...
}
2. Functions
Used to modularize logic (e.g., check_answer(), load_question(), finish_quiz()).

3. Conditional Statements
Used to check if user input is correct and control program flow.

python
Copy
Edit
if user_ans == correct_ans:
4. Loops
for loop (indirectly via enumerate) and loop control with current_question to load one question at a time.

5. Random Module
random.sample() is used to select 5 random questions from the dictionary.

6. File Handling
Read/write the high score using:

python
Copy
Edit
with open("highscore.txt", "r/w") as f:
7. String Methods
lower(), strip() are used to normalize user input for accurate comparison.

8. Exception Handling
try-except is used to handle file reading errors for the high score file.

9. Tkinter (GUI Module)
GUI components like Label, Entry, Button

pack() layout manager

messagebox for pop-up alerts

mainloop() for the GUI event loop

10. Global Variables
Used to maintain state across multiple function calls (score, current_question).

11. Program Structure
Clear separation between logic and UI

Organized into reusable functions
